## Summary

**[1] Online Business Sales 2017-2019**

Creating graphs with Matplotlib was seamless. Aligning graphs in a grid was initially tedious but improved after exploring Matplotlib's gridspec documentation.
Key takeaways include using appropriate charts, labeling properly, identifying correlations, and recognizing that correlation doesnâ€™t equal causation. Drafting hypotheses and predicting trends is essential.

**[2] OpenWeatherMap**

Visualizing how latitude affects various characteristics was straightforward.
Automating data gathering and API calls was complex.
The project has many expansion opportunities, but it's crucial to avoid reinventing existing climate data work. Collaborating with researchers can highlight areas for further exploration.
