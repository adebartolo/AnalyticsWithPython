# Analytics With Python 


This repository serves to demonstrate the applications of Python and several libraries for data analysis. Python code is saved in Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files, while datasets can be found in the csv files.

## Summary

**[1] Online Business Sales 2017-2019**

Easiest tasks: Using Matplotlib made creating graphs a seamless experience.

Challenging tasks:
At first, aligning the graphs in a grid was tedious, but it became easier to implement after reading various documentation about matplotlib gridspec.

Insights:
The 3-minute summary was most likely the most important part of the project. It is important to interpret the results of the output in an easily digestible manner that many people can understand. When analyzing graphs, it is important to:
- Make sure to use appropriate types of charts, and ensure that everything is properly labeled
- Identify any correlations and trends
- Understand how a predictor variable affects a response variable
- Compare trends 
- It is helpful to draft a hypothesis and make a prediction about future trends
- Remember that correlation does not equal causation; there may be underlying unaccounted variables

**[2] OpenWeatherMap**

Easiest tasks: It was easy to set up graphs to visualize how the latitude affects various characteristics.

Challenging tasks: The most difficult part was automating a way to gather data and make API calls.

Insights: This project can be expanded in many ways. However, is important to not waste time "reinventing the wheel.” Historical climate data is already being explored and visualized by many researchers. It would be beneficial to work with other researchers to figure out what work still needs to be done to create further insights.


**[3] Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews**

Easiest tasks: Despite having limited experience with word clouds, it was easy to implement.

Challenging tasks: There were some issues converting floats to strings in the data frame, as well as implementing Plotly.

Insights:
Analyzing review data is incredibly telling in regards to understanding a customer’s journey from their point of view. Although analyzing polarity sentiments can be time-consuming, it is worth the investment to better understand what changes need to be made to satisfy customers.
